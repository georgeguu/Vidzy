<h1>Delete a Video</h1>

<!-- The ng-model attribute is another directive that we use for data binding. -->
<!-- For example, when the value of title text box is changed, Angular will automatically set it in $scope.video.title. -->
<p>
    Are you sure you want to delete this video?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Title: {{video.title}}</li>
    <li>Description: {{video.description}}</li>
</ul>
    <!-- The ng-click attribute is yet another Angular directive that we use to handle the click event of HTML elements. -->
    <!-- weâ€™re telling Angular that if the user clicks this button, it should execute the save method on the $scope, which we defined in vidzy.js. -->
    <input type="button" value="Yes, Delete" class="btn btn-danger" ng-click="delete()" />
    <a class="btn btn-default" href="/#/">No, Go Back</a>
